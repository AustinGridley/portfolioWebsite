<!--Ideas to improve the website-->

<!--More dice-->
<!--Eventually I'd like the user to be able to input how many dice they would like to roll-->
<!--So this identifies which dice is which and will eventually need to be an id with a function-->

<!--I could fix the css so that I use padding instead of empty lines-->

<!--Notice that when I start the page this icon is here. I'd like either-->
<!--1. I'd like this to show just an icon from either 1-6 (7+ would just be the dice icon)-->
<!--2. The number rolled surrounded by normal dice icons-->

<!--The bottom part idk if I should do the dice icons with question marks especially when I fix the white space to have dice icons-->
<!--Also I'd like to make the bottom part where it originally presents the question are you feeling lucky-->
<!--Then half the time they get a response that they got lucky or better luck next time-->
<!--Would I do this with a Boolean or a dice roll between 1-2, 1/true=lucky 2/false=unlucky with corresponding messages-->

<!--text at the bottom of the page telling them if they'd like to roll a different sided dice to change their input or to reload the page-->

<!--You rolled (a/an)? How to word this-->
